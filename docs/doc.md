# 1. Local dev environment (VS Code + Git)

1. Install tools:

   * VS Code (with Python extension), Git, conda (or Miniconda), Docker (optional but recommended).
2. Create project folder and Git repo:

   ```bash
   mkdir docparse-backend
   cd docparse-backend
   git init
   code .
   ```
3. Create conda env (or venv):

   ```bash
   conda create -n docparse python=3.10 -y
   conda activate docparse
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # mac/linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate    # windows
   ```

# 2. Minimal Python app skeleton (FastAPI)

1. Install core libs:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart pydantic[dotenv] SQLModel psycopg2-binary
   ```
2. Create file structure:

   ```
   docparse-backend/
   ├─ app/
   │  ├─ main.py
   │  ├─ api/
   │  │  └─ v1.py
   │  ├─ models.py
   │  ├─ db.py
   │  └─ services/
   │     └─ ocr_service.py
   ├─ requirements.txt
   └─ .env
   ```
3. Example `main.py`:

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   from app.api.v1 import router as v1_router

   app = FastAPI(title="DocParse API")

   app.include_router(v1_router, prefix="/api/v1")
   ```
4. Example API route `api/v1.py`:

   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, UploadFile, File
   from app.services.ocr_service import ocr_process

   router = APIRouter()

   @router.post("/parse")
   async def parse_doc(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
       # save file temporarily
       contents = await file.read()
       path = f"/tmp/{file.filename}"
       with open(path, "wb") as f:
           f.write(contents)
       result = ocr_process(path)   # synchronous for now
       return result
   ```

# 3. Database (local dev vs production)

* **Local (dev)**: use Docker Postgres

  ```bash
  docker run --name docparse-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass -e POSTGRES_USER=docparse -e POSTGRES_DB=docparse -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
  ```
* **Production**: use **Neon Postgres** (serverless). Store DATABASE\_URL in `.env`.
* Use **SQLModel** (Pydantic+SQLAlchemy style) for quick models and migrations.
  Example `db.py`:

  ```python
  from sqlmodel import SQLModel, create_engine, Session
  import os
  DB_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "postgresql://docparse:pass@localhost:5432/docparse")
  engine = create_engine(DB_URL)

  def init_db():
      SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
  ```
* Example model `models.py`:

  ```python
  from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field
  from typing import Optional

  class ParsedDoc(SQLModel, table=True):
      id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
      filename: str
      json_data: str   # store full JSON result
      status: str = "parsed"
  ```

# 4. Install OCR / ML dependencies (start small)

> **Goal:** get printed text working fast — then swap in heavier models.

1. **Tesseract** (baseline)

   * Install OS-level: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-hin` (Linux)
   * Python:

     ```bash
     pip install pytesseract pillow
     ```
   * Quick use:

     ```python
     from PIL import Image
     import pytesseract
     text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open("bill.png"), lang='eng+hin')
     ```

2. **PaddleOCR** (recommended first step — robust and multilingual)

   ```bash
   pip install paddlepaddle # choose the right wheel for your CUDA version
   pip install paddleocr
   ```

   Example:

   ```python
   from paddleocr import PaddleOCR
   ocr = PaddleOCR(lang='en')  # 'en', 'hi', or other
   result = ocr.ocr("bill.png", cls=True)
   ```

3. **TrOCR / DocTR** (for later, higher-accuracy experiments)

   * TrOCR (HuggingFace): install `transformers` and be cautious about VRAM. Use CPU for initial trials.
   * DocTR: `pip install python-doctr`

# 5. Basic OCR service (sync → later background)

Create `app/services/ocr_service.py`:

```python
from paddleocr import PaddleOCR
ocr = PaddleOCR(lang='en')  # init once

def ocr_process(path: str):
    result = ocr.ocr(path, cls=True)
    # convert result to simple JSON: lines + boxes + confidences
    data = []
    for line in result:
        for box, txt, conf in line:
            data.append({"text": txt, "box": box, "conf": float(conf)})
    return {"filename": path, "lines": data}
```

* **Note:** Keep model instances global so they are loaded once per process.

# 6. Preprocessing (OpenCV) — improves OCR

Install: `pip install opencv-python`
Useful functions:

* `deskew`, `binarize`, `adaptiveThreshold`, `denoise`, `resize`, `contrast`
  Example preprocessing pipeline:

```python
import cv2
def preprocess(path):
    img = cv2.imread(path, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    # denoise and binarize
    blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (3,3), 0)
    _, th = cv2.threshold(blur, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
    return th
```

Call `preprocess()` before OCR.

# 7. Layout segmentation (Roboflow → model)

* Annotate (Roboflow or Label Studio): fields like `header`, `bill_table`, `line_item`, `doctor_stamp`.
* Export dataset and fine-tune an object-detection model (e.g., YOLOv8 / Detectron2).
* Use detected boxes to crop regions and run OCR per region (better accuracy for tables vs free text).

# 8. Entity extraction / NLP (NER + normalization)

1. Minimal (rule-based + fuzzy matching):

   * Use regex for dates, currency; RapidFuzz for drug name matching to your drug DB.
   * `pip install rapidfuzz`
2. ML NER:

   * Fine-tune **LayoutLMv3** (for layout-aware extraction) or **spaCy** + transformer.
   * HuggingFace stack:

     ```bash
     pip install transformers datasets seqeval
     ```
   * For Indic languages, use **IndicBERT** or mBERT.
3. Spell-correction:

   * Use **SymSpell** or fine-tune a small seq2seq model (T5-small) on OCR-noisy → clean pairs.

# 9. Validation & Normalization

* Maintain canonical drug table (CSV/DB): `drug_name`, `mg`, `form`, `MRP`.
* After extraction, run fuzzy lookup with thresholds (e.g., ratio > 85%) then standardize to canonical entry.
* Validate totals: sum line items and compare with invoice total; if mismatch > tolerance → flag.

# 10. Background processing & queues (scale later)

* For longer OCR/ML jobs, use Celery/RQ:

  ```bash
  pip install celery redis
  ```
* Worker picks jobs and runs heavy models; the API immediately returns a job\_id.

# 11. Storing results in Neon Postgres (or local Postgres)

* Use SQLModel session to create `ParsedDoc` record with `json_data`.
* Example insert:

  ```python
  from app.db import engine, Session
  from app.models import ParsedDoc
  with Session(engine) as session:
      doc = ParsedDoc(filename="bill.png", json_data=json.dumps(result))
      session.add(doc)
      session.commit()
  ```

# 12. API design for app integration

* **Endpoints**

  * `POST /api/v1/parse` — upload file → returns job id or JSON result
  * `GET /api/v1/status/{job_id}` — job status
  * `GET /api/v1/doc/{doc_id}` — fetch parsed JSON
* **Auth**: JWT via `fastapi-jwt-auth` or `fastapi-users`.
* **CORS**: allow React Native host during dev.

# 13. Containerization (optional early)

* `Dockerfile` for FastAPI with Python environment (use multi-stage build). Example simple Dockerfile:

  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.10-slim
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY requirements.txt .
  RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
  COPY . .
  CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000", "--workers", "1"]
  ```
* `docker-compose.yml` to include Postgres + Redis (for Celery).

# 14. Local testing and running

* Run Uvicorn:

  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```
* Test with `curl` or Postman:

  ```bash
  curl -F "file=@/path/bill.png" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/parse
  ```

# 15. Move to mobile (React Native) — basic plan

1. Create RN app (Expo or React Native CLI). Expo is easier to start:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   expo init DocParseApp
   ```
2. Feature: upload an image

   * Use `expo-image-picker` or `react-native-image-picker`
   * POST to `/api/v1/parse` using `fetch` with a multipart form
3. Poll or subscribe for job status; display parsed JSON.
4. Optional: show highlighted text by mapping boxes → overlay on image.

# 16. Production considerations & best practices

* Load models at app startup to avoid repeated loading.
* Set GPU batch sizes small (6GB GPU constraint). Use FP16 where supported.
* Add logging (Sentry) and metrics (Prometheus + Grafana).
* Always store raw original file for audit.
* Add feature toggles for model selection (fast baseline vs accurate slow).
* Keep PII security: encrypt DB at rest, use HTTPS, and obtain consent for patient data.

# 17. Next steps / checkpoints (suggested timeline)

1. Day 1–3: Env setup + FastAPI skeleton + local Postgres (Docker) + Tesseract baseline parse.
2. Day 4–7: Integrate PaddleOCR, add preprocessing (OpenCV), save result to DB. Add simple UI in React Native to upload.
3. Week 2: Annotate 50–100 pages (Roboflow/Label Studio), train layout segmentation model.
4. Week 3: Add NER (rule-based → fine-tune LayoutLM), normalization with drug DB.
5. Week 4: Background task queue, CI/CD basics, basic deployment to provider (Render/Heroku/AWS).

---



Python Backend (FastAPI or Flask)

Endpoints like:

POST /parse → takes an uploaded image/PDF, runs OCR → NLP → JSON → saves in Postgres.

GET /records/:patient_id → returns parsed data from DB for patient.

Can be deployed on Render / Railway / AWS / GCP.

Neon Postgres Database

Stores patient data, parsed JSON, and metadata.

Central hub for analytics & app queries.

React Native App (Patient-facing)

Feature 1: Upload medical bills, prescriptions, reports.

Feature 2: View parsed + validated details (e.g. drug list, costs).

Feature 3: Track claim status or expenses over time.

Feature 4 (future): Compare drug costs, suggest generics, or link to pharmacies.

Future Additions

Role-based access → doctors/pharmacies can validate directly.

Notifications when claims or verifications are done.

AI-based summaries for patients (e.g. “You spent ₹2,100 this month on medicines”).



1. OCR (best pretrained models)

Since you want the best possible pretrained OCR to start with:

TrOCR (Microsoft, HuggingFace) → Transformer-based, strong on both printed & handwritten, multilingual support.

PaddleOCR → robust on noisy/real-world docs, great multilingual support (English + Indic).

DocTR (Mindee) → deep CNN+Transformer OCR, GPU-ready, integrates with PyTorch.

Recommendation:

Start with PaddleOCR for quick experiments.

Keep TrOCR in mind for fine-tuning later on medical text (HuggingFace makes this easy).

DocTR if you want a research-grade, layout-aware backbone.

2. Layout Segmentation

Correct — eventually you’ll need layout segmentation for bills, forms, reports.

Options:

LayoutLMv3 / LayoutXLM (HuggingFace): pretrained for text+layout understanding.

Donut (Clova AI): OCR-free model that directly outputs structured data → very powerful if you have labeled invoices.

Roboflow: great for quick dataset annotation (bounding boxes for fields, tables, signatures, stamps).

Best approach: use Roboflow to annotate your own medical bill dataset → then fine-tune LayoutLMv3 on that.

3. Domain-Aware NLP Layer

You’re right: once raw text is extracted, you need an NLP post-processor:

Spell correction → SymSpell / seq2seq fine-tuned on synthetic OCR noise.

NER / Entity extraction → IndicBERT / BioBERT / fine-tuned LayoutLM for “DrugName, Dosage, Price, Date”.

Validation → match against a medicine/price database (like All India Drug Bank, NPPA MRP list).

This ensures “Paracetmol” → “Paracetamol” but won’t change legitimate terms.

4. Storage & Integration

Neon Postgres is a great choice (serverless + scalable).

Export parsed documents in JSON or CSV, then insert into Postgres.

Build a schema like:

patient_id | doctor_name | hospital | drug_name | dosage | quantity | price | bill_total | json_raw


This lets you both run analytics and keep the raw JSON for auditing.

5. Future Improvements

Add confidence scores → flag low-confidence OCR/NLP outputs for human review.

Add table parsing (Camelot, DeepDeSRT, or LayoutLM table head) for invoices.

Expand to multilingual Indic OCR (IndicOCR, AI4Bharat models).

Build a FastAPI service → so you can upload a doc and get JSON instantly.




what i want is that maybe in future i may need to perform layout segmentation on the datasets i have of medical documents so i was planning on using roboflow for that but i want the absolutely best pretrained model for the initial ocr detection phases after which i will move to medical bills and use on then via layout segmentation and then i want to be domain aware using some nlp to check the detected text and verify it against some medicine database i have and some more also auto correct some spellings detected incorrectly and then connect everything to a neon postgres database such that the extracted text and details are converted to json or csv ad imprted to my database some more improvements will follow in the way



i initially want to develop an ml model that can perform NLP powered parsing on any document, more like a general model. but the focus of my roject is currently on cghs scheme. 2. i have very less available document like some 20 so yes we need to search the internet or kaggle for samples. 3. yes researching into preexisting models is a great starting. indicbert is a good one for indian languages and maybe it is open-source can i install it locally and run it 4. i do not have as such priority instead i also want to develop a centralised platform where ine can store all medical information by parsing documents so all such documents are in riority 5. tesseract, indicbert, layoutlm, doctr are good and must be considered but see i actually want to create a model of my own kind of not from complete scratch but reading documentations of opensource models and their algos used and combinig models to create a comprehensive pipeline system that must be integrated to a database on online medicines and more medical information to autocorrect and understand what to interpret from a document but do not change it.

is a document parsing pipeline relevant in prospect to Indian healthcare system i am mainly talking about the CGHS scheme of Indian government. please also read the FAQs pdf i attached. It allows reimbursement of money spent on medication and bills. I want to develop a pipeline mainly that will allow patients to click images of bills and other documents and my model finetuned over some NLP that i can run on my 3050 6 gb gpu and 24 gb ram system locally, will extract all the relevant information from it in json format that must be stored in a database. the further process will include a lot of things what important parameters to extract how to verify bills and compare mrps of listed medicines and other expenses against some other database. but right now i want to focus only on the ml model/pipeline that will allow this document parsing. but see i a targeting not only printed documents but also handwritten docs that too not only in english but also in hindi, more regional language support can be thought of later. also, there will be grammatical and more mistakes that must be automatically corrected also follow some uniform system of maintaining the names in the db. maintaining consistency also at the same time not changing the medication and more things to consider
