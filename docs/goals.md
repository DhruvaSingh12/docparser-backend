# DocParse: CGHS Medical Document Parsing System

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Create a comprehensive AI-powered document parsing pipeline specifically designed for the Indian healthcare system, with initial focus on the CGHS (Central Government Health Scheme) reimbursement process.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Multi-Modal Document Processing
- **Target Documents**: Medical bills, prescriptions, diagnostic reports, discharge summaries
- **Input Formats**: Both printed and handwritten documents
- **Language Support**: English and Hindi (with future expansion to regional languages)
- **Document Quality**: Handle noisy, real-world documents with varying quality

### 2. Intelligent OCR Pipeline
- **Base Technology**: Combine best-in-class pretrained models (PaddleOCR, TrOCR, DocTR)
- **Layout Understanding**: Future integration with Roboflow for layout segmentation
- **Accuracy Focus**: Optimize for medical terminology and Indian healthcare context

### 3. Domain-Aware NLP Processing
- **Spell Correction**: Auto-correct OCR errors while preserving medical terminology integrity
- **Entity Recognition**: Extract key medical entities (drug names, dosages, prices, dates, doctor details)
- **Validation**: Cross-reference against medicine databases and MRP lists
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform naming conventions without altering original medical information

### 4. CGHS Scheme Integration
- **Reimbursement Focus**: Extract all parameters relevant to CGHS claim processing
- **Bill Validation**: Verify authenticity and completeness of medical bills
- **MRP Verification**: Compare extracted prices against standard MRP databases
- **Compliance**: Ensure extracted data meets CGHS documentation requirements

### 5. Centralized Medical Information Platform
- **Database Integration**: Store parsed data in Neon PostgreSQL
- **JSON/CSV Export**: Structured data export for analysis and reporting
- **Patient Records**: Maintain comprehensive medical document history
- **Analytics Ready**: Design schema for future healthcare analytics

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Constraints
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3050 (6GB VRAM)
- **RAM**: 24GB system memory
- **Local Deployment**: All models must run efficiently on local hardware

### Model Architecture Goals
- **Custom Pipeline**: Build proprietary solution combining open-source components
- **Modular Design**: Each component (OCR, NLP, Validation) should be independently upgradeable
- **Performance Optimized**: Real-time processing for mobile app integration
- **Scalable**: Design for future cloud deployment

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Indian Healthcare Focus
- **CGHS Specific**: Tailored for government healthcare scheme requirements
- **Regional Language Support**: Hindi and future Indic language capabilities
- **Medical Context**: Understanding of Indian medical practices and terminology

### 2. Handwriting Recognition
- **Doctor Prescriptions**: Handle medical handwriting variations
- **Patient Information**: Process handwritten forms and documents
- **Mixed Content**: Documents with both printed and handwritten elements

### 3. Intelligent Validation
- **Medicine Database Integration**: Real-time validation against drug databases
- **Price Verification**: MRP and cost validation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flag suspicious or incorrect entries

### 4. End-to-End Solution
- **Document Upload**: Mobile app integration for image capture
- **Processing Pipeline**: Automated OCR → NLP → Validation → Storage
- **Result Delivery**: Structured JSON output for downstream applications

## Business Impact

### 1. CGHS Reimbursement Efficiency
- **Faster Processing**: Automated document parsing reduces manual review time
- **Error Reduction**: Intelligent validation prevents common claim errors
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced administrative overhead for healthcare providers

### 2. Patient Experience

- **Drug Utilization**: Insights into prescription patterns
- **Policy Insights**: Data-driven healthcare policy recommendations

## Future Expansion Opportunities

### 1. Additional Schemes
- **ESI (Employee State Insurance)**: Extend to other government healthcare schemes
- **Private Insurance**: Support for private health insurance claims
- **State Schemes**: Integration with state-specific healthcare programs

### 2. Advanced Features
- **Fraud Detection**: AI-powered anomaly detection for bill verification
- **Drug Interaction Warnings**: Cross-reference prescriptions for safety
- **Cost Optimization**: Suggest generic alternatives and cost-saving measures

### 3. Platform Integration
- **Hospital Systems**: Integration with existing hospital management systems
- **Government Portals**: Direct integration with CGHS online portals
- **Pharmacy Networks**: Connect with pharmacy systems for direct billing

## Success Metrics
